# Overview

This repository contains all the scripts associated to the paper:

*Environmental stress contributes to diverging DNA methylation and expression response in early stages of polyploidy*, _Milosavljevic_ et al. (2023)

Each folder includes different stages and output of the analyses:

  - **ARPEGGIO_analyses** includes `config.yaml` and `metadata.txt` files to use to reproduce all the analyses done with [ARPEGGIO](https://github.com/supermaxiste/ARPEGGIO) together with reports about data quality analyses. These files are provided for all comparisons discussed. More details about how to use these files can be found in the `README` files in each folder. For additional questions, feel free to open an issue.

   - **downstream_analyses** includes all the scripts used for main and supplementary results (plots included).

   - **METHImpute_analyses** includes all scripts and files required to run and reproduce the results obtained with `METHImpute`. Since the procedure is more elaborate and the output was used for further downstream analyses, this part is in a separate folder.
